<p>You turn your ship around and fly straight back to Brachya, the most beautiful planet in space, and dock your ship at the port nearest the Royal Compound.   After powering down the Cockleshell, you steel yourself and stride through the audience hall doors.  The guards don&#39;t stop you; they know you for a loyal servant to Her Divine Crustaceasness, and they casually salute as you stride by. </p>

<p>You march up to the throne, where Divine Brachyura sits on her throne.  It&#39;s a sturdy, imposing structure, and Divine Brachyura is a sturdy, imposing crab.  You take a deep breath; you had forgotten she might be in crabform.  Of all your people, only Divine Brachyura has the knack of shifting to crabform at will, and she often spends her public audience time in full crab.  She looks at you expectantly with her gracefully protruding eyeballs, and you clear your throat.</p>

<p>&quot;Divine Brachyura,&quot; you declare, standing squarely before her, &quot;you are acting like a hermit crab, paranoid and fearful.&quot;</p>

<p>Divine Brachyura throws her claws into the air, waving them menacingly over your head.  You maintain your position, moving only to wipe away the sweat that has somehow sprung to your brow in a matter of seconds. </p> 

<p>&quot;BLAAAAASPHEMY,&quot; she roars, glaring down at you from the throne.  Yup, she&#39;s angry, all right, but things might still work out okay...and then you see her third pincer clacking, and hope drains from you like sand from a perforated lunch bucket.  <i>If the third pincer&#39;s clacking</i>, you think inanely, remember the song you and your classmates used to sing back in Space Crab Academy, <i>you&#39;d best be backing....AWAAAAAY!</i>  But now you&#39;re glued to the spot, watching Divine Brachyura, awaiting your doom.</p>

<p>Clacking all three pincers meaningfully, Divine Brachyura scuttles down from her throne and slams her dominant claw over your head, crushing your skull and sending gray brain matter flying in all directions.</p>

<p> If only your human form had included a nice, hard exoskeleton!  Ah, well.</p>

<p>THE END.</p>
