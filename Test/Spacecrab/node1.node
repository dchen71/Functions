<p>You&#39;re in the ship again, drifting.  </p>

<p>You&#39;re supposed to be scouting the sector for crabbers, by order of the Divine Brachyura herself.  Your Cockleshell 2600 is equipped with chelae for pincering at close range, as well as xanthidaen lasers and long-range bombs for space battle.  It wouldn&#39;t be much help in a pitched battle, but it should do the trick if you need to beat a hasty retreat and leave some cover-fire in your wake to discourage pursuit.</p>  

<p>&quot;Scuttle out and look about,&quot; Divine Brachyura had ordered, waving you out of her audience hall.  Even in humanoid form, she thought like a true crustacean.  Scuttle out, indeed.  You shake your head in admiration; some day, perhaps, you&#39;ll be as crustaceas as Divine Brachyura.  Unlike her, though, you&#39;d never send your people out chasing waves on the sand.  Day after day, despite your protests, she sends you out to patrol for crabbers—carcinologists, as they&#39;re called in polite company.  Every day, she says the same thing.  &quot;You never know where carcinologists might be hiding.  You never know when they&#39;ll be right on our doorstep!&quot;</p><p>

</p><p> Actually, you <i>do</i> know.  Crabbers haven&#39;t been spotted in this sector since long before you were born.  Even your parents find Divine Brachyura&#39;s obsession with crabbers a bit odd, though they never say so outright.  Your mother told you once that she could barely remember the last time a crabber had been spotted even by wide-ranging crabships.  You frown.  These missions are boring and pointless, and you&#39;d tell Her Divine Crustaceasness that, too...if you weren&#39;t terrified of her.  You shake your head.  You really ought to <a data-dest1="node2">march into that audience hall and tell Divine Brachyura that she&#39;s acting like a hermit crab</a>, paranoid and fearful.</p>  You wince, imagining Mother&#39;s face after she heard about you making a scene like <i>that</i>.  Not one of your better ideas, maybe.

<p>In any case, you spend all your patrol trips exploring rather than patrolling.  There&#39;s more to see even in this one sector than you could examine in a lifetime.  You&#39;ve roved all over in your Cockleshell 2600, taking in as many sights as you can.  It makes patrol time pass faster, and there&#39;s no one out here to stop you or report back to Divine Brachyura.  The only thing you have to avoid is that shiny dark spot out past Veddu, the larger of the nearby planet Sessilia&#39;s moons. </p>

<p>The dark spot has been explored before, and you know what it is: a deathstarfish, one of those fabled moon-sized beasts that feeds on planets.  You look at it through the viewscreen.  It&#39;s never bothered Brachya; despite their fearsome reputation, deathstarfish only eat a planet every few centuries. They spend the rest of the time digesting.  You shudder and turn away from the deathstarfish.  It doesn&#39;t bother small spacecrafts, but nonetheless it scares you silly.</p>

<p>Straight ahead, <a data-dest1="node3">something sparkles green and blue in the distance.</a>  And Verru, nearby Sessilia&#39;s second moon, is transmitting <a data-dest1="node4">some kind of signal</a>—which is odd, since nothing lives there.  These two are much more interesting (and less horrifying) than an old deathstarfish.</p> 

<p>Already, you&#39;re faced with choices.</p>
